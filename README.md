# Setting up a new project

There are tests setup regarding the repository location and license. One you make a change to reflect the forked repository location or license, you will need to update all affected areas to get the tests to pass. See the `spec/project` folder for these tests.

This project is setup to integrate with services that you will need to configure with a forked repository:

1. Travis
1. AppVeyor
1. Code Climate
1. David.
1. Gitter
